# Example

## Equations 

This is an example file with example equations: $e=mc^2$

Another equation: 

<Eq>
    \nu Te \mathcal{X}
</Eq>

There is an equation transformer for KaTeX which you can turn on. I decided to remove it from main because I find it more convenient to render equations using KaTeX in React.

# Variables

You can insert variables like this: ${myVariable}

Variables only work in text right now. Variables are not supported in math or environment attributes.
